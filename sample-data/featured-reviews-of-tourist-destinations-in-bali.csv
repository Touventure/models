ChIJx97hVM9E0i0RUVpPBj5miBk,Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park,"Tourist trap and a massive waste of time.

I remember visiting the more authentic parts of the park before all the development but they have tried to turn it into a theme park, with the queues, and the shiny front, but minus the fun.

Not to say that I expected the fun, I would have appreciated the cultural aspects of the park if the management didn't charge so much for the experience.

Why was this a tourist trap?

At the first entrance, we were told that our entry tickets included a buggy ride from quite an unfriendly driver (can't fault him, it was a thankless job of driving visitors up and down a hill the entire day) to the foot of the massive statue. The statue was impressive, but when we went into the building, and walked all the way to the end of a hallway, we were the told that there was another additional charge for visiting the interior of the Garuda Wisnu building.

If not, that was it. We could either walk down or take the buggy back down to the midpoint where we could walk around to visit the other monuments. This is about the most authentic part of the experience and well worth the visit, but not the entire facade.

Is it a problem with the ticket value? I don't think so, I think it is just a problem with not setting expectations from the start, thus making visitors feel cheated.",Why Keen Tham (whykeen),2,"Tourist trap and a massive waste of time.

I remember visiting the more authentic parts of the park before all the development but they have tried to turn it into a theme park, with the queues, and the shiny front, but minus the fun.

Not to say that I expected the fun, I would have appreciated the cultural aspects of the park if the management didn't charge so much for the experience.

Why was this a tourist trap?

At the first entrance, we were told that our entry tickets included a buggy ride from quite an unfriendly driver (can't fault him, it was a thankless job of driving visitors up and down a hill the entire day) to the foot of the massive statue. The statue was impressive, but when we went into the building, and walked all the way to the end of a hallway, we were the told that there was another additional charge for visiting the interior of the Garuda Wisnu building.

If not, that was it. We could either walk down or take the buggy back down to the midpoint where we could walk around to visit the other monuments. This is about the most authentic part of the experience and well worth the visit, but not the entire facade.

The tickets also included entry to some cultural shows, and a museum. All of these felt artificial somehow.

Saran saya jalan kaki saja untuk menikmati suasana disekitar pintu masuk.

Saya juga menyarankan untuk masuk ke Studio Foto Asana dan ambil paket foto dengan Baju Tradisional Bali/Jawa dengan puluhan latar yang menarik.

Jangan lupa juga untuk menonton pertunjukan tari khas Bali di teaternya setiap jam mulai pukul 10:00 WITA sampai sore, dan  tari terakhir saat sunset merupakan tari kecak yang ikonik.

Garuda Wisnu Kencana Park offers a garden with a unique atmosphere and statues which are the main focus of this place. There are 3 large statues in this place, the Vishnu statue, the Garuda statue, and the largest is the Garuda Wisnu Kencana statue. Apart from the three statues, there are also several statues scattered along the entrance to the back of this place.

This place not only offers iconic statues, there is also a place to buy various souvenirs, there is a performance stage, Asana Photo Studio, and a restaurant.

To get to the ticket purchase area from the parking lot, a free shuttle bus is provided. Arriving at the place of purchase of tickets, you can buy cash or non-cash. Domestic ticket price Rp. 125,000 per person, but usually there are promotions. There are two routes you can choose to enter, walking for free or taking a shuttle but paying Rp. 30,000 per person. My suggestion is to just walk to enjoy the atmosphere around the entrance.

I also suggest going to the Asana Photo Studio and taking a photo package with Traditional Balinese/Javanese Clothes with dozens of interesting backgrounds.

Don't forget to watch Balinese dance performances in the theater every hour from 10:00 WITA until afternoon, and the final dance at sunset is the iconic Kecak dance.

There is also a restaurant but I didn't have time to go in, you can exchange your entrance ticket for free water.

Went with my family, and we had a guide who helped us out a lot. Showing us the good places to take photos, and unfortunately there was a section closed off for an event.

It would have been nice if the fish had some plants in the water, now its kinda said for them.

Just a heads up, avoid the super busy days and check the weather. Monkey traffic and rain aren't fun.

Even if there have been signs to not get close to monkeys some people were encouraging them to hop on their back.

Beautiful statues and lots of greenery. There are few gift shops inside on outer path- but they offer same stuff as any shop out of Monkey Forest.

ChIJZ5sY9kM90i0RVsPvSxZD7LY,Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary,"This place is a must visit when you're in Ubud. It was the highlight of the trip.

Purchasing tickets was super easy and fast for us. There were plenty of people there but it's a big place so it didn't feel too crowded.

The monkeys are amazing to look at. The human expressions and how they use their hands makes it so easy to see how they're our distant cousins.

There were plenty of staff around to assist in most places and there was a fun addition 'monkey selfie' you can pay 50k for which is worth it for great pics and getting even closer to a monkey.

When they yawn or bare their teeth you can see their huge sharp teeth which is a reminder to show them respect.

So long as you follow the very clearly marked rules you should be fine, but be prepared for some monkeys to try and get close or even on you. It's fine as long as you stand up and encourage them to get off quickly.

We were there for a good few hours and it was such a wonderful experience. We saw two people get bit by the monkeys but they were not following the rules and were getting a bit too close to them.

Even just the grounds are a wonderful thing to see. So beautifully kept and adorned with many old looking statues and shrines.

Would recommend to everyone to do this when in Ubud!",Jon Adams,5,"This place is a must visit when you're in Ubud. It was the highlight of the trip.

ChIJZ5sY9kM90i0RVsPvSxZD7LY,Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary,"The Sacred Monkey Forest in Bali is nothing short of a thrilling jungle adventure that immerses you in a realm where nature, spirituality, and mischievous monkeys converge. From the moment you step into this enchanting sanctuary, you are greeted by the lively chatter of long-tailed macaques and the lush, vibrant foliage that forms the backdrop to this captivating experience.

Walking through the ancient moss-covered stone entrance feels like stepping into a mystical realm where centuries-old temples stand in harmony with the playful antics of the resident monkeys. The air is filled with an electric energy, a palpable fusion of the sacred and the wild.

The monkeys, considered sacred guardians of the forest, are the true stars of this show. Their cheeky antics, acrobatic displays, and curious nature create an atmosphere of constant excitement. From adorable infants clinging to their mothers to mischievous adolescents engaging in playful games, every corner of the forest is alive with the dynamic energy of these captivating creatures.

Interacting with the monkeys adds an element of unpredictability to the experience. Whether they're gently accepting a banana from your hand or demonstrating their agility by leaping from branch to branch, each encounter is a unique and exhilarating moment. It's a delightful dance of coexistence between humans and primates, set against the backdrop of ancient mossy temples and towering banyan trees.

The forest itself is a work of art, a carefully preserved ecosystem that invites exploration. The pathways wind through dense foliage, revealing hidden shrines, moss-covered statues, and tranquil streams. The ambient sounds of rustling leaves and distant monkey calls create a symphony that accompanies your journey through this natural wonderland.

The sacred temples within the forest add a layer of cultural richness to the experience. The intricate stone carvings and ancient architecture transport you back in time, offering a glimpse into Bali's spiritual heritage. The juxtaposition of the sacred and the untamed creates a harmonious balance that is both awe-inspiring and invigorating.

In conclusion, the Sacred Monkey Forest in Bali is not just a tourist attraction; it's a thrilling escapade into a world where nature and spirituality intertwine. The mischievous monkeys, ancient temples, and lush greenery combine to create an experience that is as exhilarating as it is enchanting.

Staff should learn to actually care about their paying customers and help take some really nice shots for them.,a month ago,2023-11-07T02:33:58.823000,,,,1,61,6,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102103563228938864739/reviews?entry=ttu,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLU9WdEu--tIje5KnFFWlm-GXV_EGXzR0KvYP06vWfL=s120-c-rp-mo-br100,False,,,"['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMbtdJArLwxmcT43Lf_mQEs9Gp5AoJb2Au2kotu=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMUMTVtGtcnDdsNsCy7VUXMH-r_81yc45pjZAFP=w150-h150-k-no-p']"

Make sure you attend all the shows on the list, interact with the birds. It really worth it!
My favorite was black cockatoo Mary, she is smart and likes to be pet.

Wow, just now Tegalalang is this cool.
I recommend coming here for tourism in Ubud, it might be a bit difficult if you bring elderly people, but because the road goes up and down, be extra careful.

The rice fields are beautiful, though, highly recommended.",a month ago,2023-10-19T14:27:13.993000,,,,0,190,394,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104241754385614159979/reviews?entry=ttu,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVyeeBBz68bTogH0Uey52cNxscUYe3giEM9YR0rW9548V8=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100,True,,,"['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOr6-yXjU1h7ubZOMuGNSqUc25r02ruxH9wE20w=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3Vr6SG_Xo_Xu9koNhoUxZ2LQA5Ufw_WsM725-=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOEah4rNmXvUiszt7JaT8__q7awuCvTW1N7cEyz=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNUkRmGhXokan9K3JR16akYnNdL9JvCrim-sqps=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP6h9HV8ohRj110-G1foJu4mRU2HaLU-xaXtmOA=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNad6usyPPDaUg2oEcy3YqtvQQDhu2DM3TLGKZ5=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPzUVyt73h6gO_n_JPz7Q9qWVBSqI-olyOk0FJL=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN27Hl2yGlClXnywe3Z6Zb2DhXvpD2KqLNyZHmz=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMgBvzSQ87vNEOElBflsVmMZfbuI6TN2sMZl5Dk=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPY45k8GRe3rSb0M4BEOYkimRfrPtNIX7iIUXbT=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNZqbAow1oPKfdaxOkGKdQeAGfKQT0lTatr12JX=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNcN0Mzy-9cDjmc3pCurtez7kpgyWVW5oUjCIbv=w150-h150-k-no-p']"

""I had an incredible experience visiting Tukad Waterfall. The natural beauty of this place is simply breathtaking. The trek down to the waterfall was an adventure in itself, with lush greenery and the soothing sound of the river. When I reached the waterfall, I was awestruck by its majesty.

The clear, cool water cascading down into the pool was perfect for a refreshing swim, and the surrounding rocks and cliffs made for great photo opportunities. It's a relatively hidden gem, so it's not as crowded as some other tourist spots.

The whole experience was made even better by the friendly local guides who shared interesting stories and facts about the area. If you're in Bali, Tukad Waterfall is a must-visit.

Enough space and time to make pictures and enjoy the water. It's a beautiful walk to the waterfall because you're passing rice fields and other bodies of water were different plants are growing. A lot of little cafes where you can take a break and drink/eat something.

I don't recommend going if you're out of breath after half a minute walking stairs.

The tour itself is very enjoyable, the views are amazing, you have the option to climb like a boulderer on the rock walls, but you can always choose to swim instead if you feel unsafe - the guide will show the way and help you whenever needed. He will also make photos of you if you'd like.

I highly recommend coming in flipflops as you will need to climb barefoot, and the slippers fit easily into the guide's bag.
Also, prepare to get fully wet as the water is quite deep in some places, so come in swimsuit.

At the end of the trip there is a short walk among the rice fields, so prepare with a t-shirt or sunscreen. Also, right at the end of the canyon there is a small shop where you can buy beer / water / extremely fresh coconut to freshen up a bit.

ChIJ9TZLexU90i0REmY1Mz24D9w,Bali Bird Walks,"I found this recommendation on Google reviews and I wasn't disappointed!

Make sure you wear decent walking shows (flip flops are not good enough) as you will be walking for a long time (about 2-3 hours) and traversing paths along paddy fields that are uneven.

You should also make sure you put on plenty of sunscreen and wear a hat and sun shades as there are a lot of parts where you are exposed fully to the sun.

Now onto the nitty gritty. We were welcomed by Sumadi at Murni's Warung (this is where the tour starts, not at the Bali Bird Walk office), who runs the tours. She is incredibly passionate about the wildlife in the area and provided us with binoculars and a list of birds we might see on the walk.

We popped into a taxi for a 10 minute drive to the start of the tour, and then, straight away, we were bird spotting.

As well as spotting birds, we were introduced to a variety of plants and their uses, such as the Star of Bethlehem and the silver fern (very cool temporary tattoo was  demonstrated!)

I also got to see water monitor lizard, golden orb spider and gliding lizard.

And amongst all of this, we were taught about the life of a rice farmer, and how the crops are grown and which animals are good for the crops, and which ones aren't (depending on the maturity of the crops). The irrigation system was fascinating.... and the hidden rules behind how it is used... not something I thought I would find interesting!

Best spot of the day was the Java Kingfisher.

ChIJ9TZLexU90i0REmY1Mz24D9w,Bali Bird Walks,"This was a wonderful experience. We jumped in without any information, and I'd like to make sure the next person knows what this is. :)

First, best way to communicate is by using WhatsApp and messaging your intent to join the bird walk. Check the website for days/hours that the walk starts. (As of right now it's Mon/Tue at 9am)
Second, the meeting point is at the golden bridge in Ubud, not at the office (the address listed is the office location.) However, we were at the office at meeting time, and they were so kind to drive over and pick us up. The drive from pickup to start of the walk is not very long- 5 minutes perhaps. Su provides guests with binoculars- so you won't miss a thing!
You will need to have local currency to pay, it was about 530,000 a person.
The group was very small, only 4, and it was absolutely the best way to learn about the culture, flora and fauna! Su (the guide) is very enthusiastic! We saw (and she identified) everything from caterpillars, spiders, and lizards to plants and birds. She took her time explaining to us the rice fields, the different stages, how they process etc and we saw rice fields in each stage (much more educational than the plantation/tourist approach you get elsewhere.)
The walking tour lasts about 3 hours- make sure you have drinking water, bug spray, and your camera(or fully charged phone!) After the walking tour the group heads to a local restaurant (lunch is included in the price.) Su continues to educate through the entire day, she is very easy to understand, has a conservation outlook, and is very knowledgeable!",Rainbeau Decker,5,"This was a wonderful experience.

First, best way to communicate is by using WhatsApp and messaging your intent to join the bird walk. Check the website for days/hours that the walk starts. (As of right now it's Mon/Tue at 9am)
Second, the meeting point is at the golden bridge in Ubud, not at the office (the address listed is the office location.) However, we were at the office at meeting time, and they were so kind to drive over and pick us up. The drive from pickup to start of the walk is not very long- 5 minutes perhaps. Su provides guests with binoculars- so you won't miss a thing!
You will need to have local currency to pay, it was about 530,000 a person.
The group was very small, only 4, and it was absolutely the best way to learn about the culture, flora and fauna! Su (the guide) is very enthusiastic! We saw (and she identified) everything from caterpillars, spiders, and lizards to plants and birds. She took her time explaining to us the rice fields, the different stages, how they process etc and we saw rice fields in each stage (much more educational than the plantation/tourist approach you get elsewhere.)
The walking tour lasts about 3 hours- make sure you have drinking water, bug spray, and your camera(or fully charged phone!) After the walking tour the group heads to a local restaurant (lunch is included in the price.) Su continues to educate through the entire day, she is very easy to understand, has a conservation outlook, and is very knowledgeable!",a year ago,2022-10-04T22:56:17.558000,,,,14,13,14,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113944059414981335482/reviews?entry=ttu,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjU77wMpOybRS_HbiGQaNDLheFs4Bx9YZoAnPSsv_4dSaEGY=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100,True,,,"['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSfn56UDiMB5KRPrsmglwwPvMxQBvRoeZq7mXK=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4563DYl7fftzkHAVGMSC3GVsFZHjdiAZIxj7k=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPa1eyRjKkEH8X-pO_z2LXFU2KSAEXwDmOh9BqQ=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnzZWoQ0T5rx4rLoenmF7AyXf0WMkN9EN1iA-h=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNn7ZvZ5fVq-39TW-CJHKB2NaLD-Lb5NEshRzIk=w150-h150-k-no-p']"

We arrived early but there's already a crowd. Entrance fee is IDR 20K. Not recommended to elderly people and people with mobility issues since you'll need to hike around 1000 steps to get near the waterfall.

Water looks brown but isn't dirty. That's what you expect if the water comes from a mountain. Swimming under the water fall isn't allowed. If you get to the top, you'll need to pay another IDR 20K for entrance fee.

There's a few day clubs where you can stay. Many stalls where you can buy stuff as well.

Spacious parking space.

ChIJL626sPVA0i0RLJoATqtQcfY,Bajra Sandhi Monument,"A beautiful monument in tribute to a beautiful people.
During my recent visit to Denpasar, I had the privilege to visit the Bajra Sandhi Monument, an iconic landmark that stands as a silent witness to the rich history and cultural tapestry of Indonesia.

As I approached the monument, I was struck by its grandeur and architectural brilliance. The monument, with its towering structure and intricate Balinese design, serves as a proud reminder of Bali's struggle for independence. Its imposing edifice commands respect and reflects the resilience and spirit of the Balinese people.

The monument is nestled amidst a lush and well-maintained garden, offering a serene and peaceful environment to ponder upon the historical narratives that it embodies. Inside, the museum offers an enlightening journey through various phases of Balinese history, depicted through a series of dioramas that are both detailed and captivating. The galleries are well-curated, providing a seamless blend of education and visual appeal.

Visitors also have the opportunity to ascend to the top of the monument, where they are greeted with a panoramic view of Denpasar. This vantage point offers a picturesque glimpse of the city's evolving skyline, set against the backdrop of the majestic Mount Agung. It is a sight that captures the harmonious blend of the old and the new, a testimony to Bali's continuous growth and development.

But what truly sets Bajra Sandhi Monument apart is its role as a space of reflection, where one can pause and appreciate the sacrifices made by those who fought for Bali's freedom. It is a place that evokes a deep sense of pride and reverence, making it a must-visit for anyone keen on understanding the spirit of Bali.

I would highly recommend a visit to the Bajra Sandhi Monument for both locals and tourists alike. It not only offers a glimpse into Bali's rich history but also serves as a source of inspiration, a beacon of resilience, unity, and hope. A true gem in the heart of Denpasar!

The water infront of the waterfalls is knee-deep and has a lot of rocks.",a month ago,2023-10-09T06:22:08.466000,Thank you for your visiting,3 months ago,2023-08-21T00:17:12.607000,11,94,361,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101419364056927072321/reviews?entry=ttu,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXYdR8H1_jqrPL3iKz3oDlXVw_asvJyai0h0urWJnKfP2c=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100,True,,,"['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMpLq9YxsU-d0S3TDGcGbpPWfHwFRixeyjQaJ2M=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNo9uHDe1-_WQs4p8-G5AEs07JfR6JGIwf8JuLp=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOyf6WaqyPo9ga2UPqtFsH0kYT36_zgYNZgiidt=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPZBU0u8UgH64Z1MpzAnK9riZsNej3caojvzdr8=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPRNSUGvzjFIzKsjYEyNEWf4UtRo7S3ERc05tMg=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNMgoJpUTRNIIUMJnkSP69GH9CL_sxryPTSumF2=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMkFJNZwA8cXG-1QOcI38ygrKbQZDJ3FNqgGF1j=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMV3-vJESDmqluOUm_Wy8e0mIzrD_m1KBzu398t=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipODyOKw55e-ILFc8Cy34YF5t5OLC1OtgNO1LG4z=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP_cQ14DSJAmokDmZDc59EhsWLXP3YSebWft5Pe=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMkKV-S1QLLRZUh2IOJJOEMo5FIisGFPY7QRBYQ=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP_Fxqtsmb0eLuQTMXcPfYpSKArKXlO35-bhDBQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']"

Dalam ulasan positif ini, kami akan menjelajahi pesona dan ketidakbiasaan yang ada di Taman Festival yang meriah dengan misteri.

Taman Festival yang pernah berkilauan sebagai proyek hiburan terbesar di Asia Tenggara kini telah menjadi tempat yang penuh misteri dan nostalgia. Ditinggalkan sejak tahun 2000, tempat ini memegang rahasia-rahasia yang memikat para pencari petualangan dan pecinta keajaiban alam.

Yang membuat Taman Festival begitu menarik adalah pengalaman mistis yang seringkali dialami oleh pengunjung yang berani menjelajahinya. Beberapa laporan melaporkan penampakan hantu dengan sosok-sosok bayangan yang melayang di kegelapan, menambah aura misteri tempat ini. Suara-suara aneh juga sering didengar, mulai dari langkah kaki hingga bisikan yang sulit dipahami. Sensasi kehadiran tak terlihat dan pengalaman gaib yang intens juga membuat kunjungan ke Taman Festival terasa sangat unik.

Bali is known as a tropical paradise that offers beautiful beaches, rich culture and stunning natural beauty. However, amidst its extraordinary charm, there is one place that exudes a unique charm thanks to its mystery and mystical things. It is the Festival Park in Padang Galak. In this positive review, we will explore the charm and unusualness that is the Festival Park that is alive with mystery.

Festival Park, which once glittered as Southeast Asia's largest entertainment project, has now become a place full of mystery and nostalgia. Abandoned since 2000, this place holds secrets that enchant adventure seekers and lovers of natural wonders.

What makes Festival Park so interesting is the mystical experience often experienced by visitors who dare to explore it. Some reports report ghostly sightings with shadowy figures floating in the darkness, adding to the aura of mystery of this place. Strange sounds are also often heard, ranging from footsteps to whispers that are difficult to understand. The sensation of an invisible presence and an intense magical experience also makes a visit to Festival Park feel very unique.

However, what you need to remember is that these mysteries are not yet certain. Many factors such as abandoned atmosphere, outdated building conditions, and psychological suggestions can influence the visitor's experience.

However, if you are an adventure lover or a fan of the mystical, Festival Park is an interesting place to explore. Concern for local culture and the environment is important when you visit this place. This way, you can explore the mysterious side of Bali while respecting its beauty and cultural heritage.",,"['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPBGel7gEyPpBFT_8DVLaUB6OmuaXvfpz8kzjU=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMfzcAkmrEkc9uLnAwtdl71C06YY2IVppxDDNk=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOD_wLPnOmqEdAm0E5kva1i-6ZPJXB6h3Gk9O4=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPTQiNdJO2U-m4rmvgipIRBsL0Z-aDAW8wKEq8=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOv9vEx10e7xXtyXeNyBlQAJM6HFLtyWD0ElEU=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPRj-N3im-xUZeaZ066GnBKZblFNPKyiNkLloc=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOZYI9swwKyRGtOgyvhkHEndSi5IyKWgpXvK_U=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOOYMywVaMjbVkeLIo6ucBDiQcOlBFdbAZqn1o=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMjo9UzTH-RJ8F6c3M4nPZGYrqkbOK7gHmQ5ck=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOlsaXq94OoU9_GqtKUxaMFPYYjUZFOO0EAx7E=w150-h150-k-no-p', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPWT_m9Lp60L4QLrfeQEsOM3uL16w1K6s1jMA0=w150-h150-k-no-p']"

ChIJgxNvhqEX0i0R-6U9ogQJ_-k,Suwat Waterfall,It's 25k to get in per person. You're greeted by two wonderful squirrels on a coconut statue with locals playing traditional music. Once you get down to the waterfall there isn't too much space around to hang out. They're building a cafe or some building to provide more space to relax at. The water is a bit cold but refreshing for the hot Bali days. You can climb on the big rock and jump off into the water under the waterfall.

If you drive a car, there's a spacious carpark for 3-4 cars but the way to get there is a bit challenging for some.

Around the carpark, there's cafe and some warungs. From there, you just need to walk about 5 mins to get to the stairs and climb down. But be really careful because the stairs are quite steep. Especially when they're wet.

There are some rocks carved around the falls.

To get to the waterfalls, you need to cross the river. Please pick a good day to come here because if it was raining a day after then the stream could be hard to cross.

Crossing can be difficult for some, but there's a guide rope which you can hang your life to it. How ever, just pray before you cross so you don't meet an anaconda swimming around or a lost crocodile.
