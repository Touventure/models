Answer: You must not have followed the guidelines. We were there for 2 hours and we're ignored by the monkeys the entire time.

Also, don't wear hats, sunglasses ( they love them for some reason) and avoid bringing any bag or backpack. If you have nothing of interest they won't bother you.

(Original)
Untuk saat covid  ini bukak atau tidak saya harap buka krna keperluan tugas (3 years ago)

Answer: (Translated by Google) The Bajra Sandhi Monument is currently still closed. Due to Covid-19 due to the ban on gatherings.

Task suggestions:
- Tell the teacher/assignee that the Bajra Sandhi Monument is still closed.
- Alternative, if you don't like the Bajra Sandhi Monument, you can use online references, for example articles or videos that are already on the ATM (observe, imitate, modify).
- Finally, thank you, and happy doing the task. Spirit 

(Original)
Monumen Bajra Sandhi sampai saat ini masih tutup. Berhubung Covid-19 karena larangan berkumpul.

Saran tugas:
- Sampaikan pada guru/pemberi tugas bahwa Monumen Bajra Sandhi masih tutup.
- Alternatif, jika kekeh mau tentang Monumen Bajra Sandhi, bisa gunakan referensi online misal artikel atau video yang sudah ada terus di ATM (amati, tiru, modifikasi).
- Akhir kata, terima kasih, dan selamat mengerjakan tugas.

For traders, there are some who are too pushy.
This is my criticism, not to drop it, but to make Kuta beach better.

(Original)
Kebersihan nya harap di tingkatkan lg baik di sepanjang pantai maupun sepanjang trotoar , tong sampah pn sangat sedikit .
Untk pedagang ada beberapa yg trllu memaksakan . 
Ini kritik sya bkn menjatuhkan tp biar pantai Kuta lbh berbenah lebih baik .
 (a year ago)

Answer: (Translated by Google) Oh yeah.. me too. Last month, women selling knick-knacks also seemed pushy and begged to be bought, but because I've often met sellers like that and I'm also used to haggling, my mother was confused and annoyed herself because at first I already said I wasn't interested in buying, but he kept on bidding... in the end I made a fair bargain. In the end he gave up.

(Original)
Oh iya.. saya juga bulan lalu ibu - ibu jual pernak pernik itu juga terkesan memaksa dan memohon untuk dibeli, tapi karena saya sudah sering ketemu yang jual seperti itu dan juga sudah biasa dalam tawar menawar, malah ibunya bingung dan kesel sendiri karena pada awal saya sudah bilang tidak minat untuk beli, tapi dia malah terus tawarin.. akhirnya saya tawar tawar ta wajar. Pada akhirnya kapok dia.
